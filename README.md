# SQL_PROJECT_01

This project is a complete SQL-based data analysis of a retail sales dataset. It covers all essential stepsâ€”from data cleaning and exploration to answering business-critical questions using SQL queries.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights related to customer behavior, product category performance, sales trends over time, and operational optimization (such as shift-wise sales). The analysis helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve sales strategy, customer targeting, and resource planning.
